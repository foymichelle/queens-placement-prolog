### Queen's Placement

In the game of chess, a Queen can move and attack any number of squares in any direction (rows, columns, and diagonals). Given a chess board of 8x8 squares and 8 queens, write a Prolog program that places the 8 queens in a board without them attacking each other. There are over 4 billion ways to place randomly place 8 queens on a board, please donâ€™t use brute force.
